# ARC

A simple 2D physics that may be expanded upon in the future. Written in C++ 17.

## To-Do

- [ ] Consider adding a file of constants like gravity
- [x] Add operators for Vec3s like '+=' or '/'
- [x] Change Body members to use proper Getter functions
- [x] Change the body files to rigid body files
- [x] Pass timestep into integrate function

- [x] Implement Dynamics
- [x] Implement 2D OpenGL example
- [x] Implement Basic AABB Collision Detection
- [ ] Implement Spheres for Collision Detection too
- [ ] Render a circle in OpenGL to use for the example
- [ ] Implement Collision Callbacks
